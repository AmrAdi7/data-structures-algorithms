# Data Structures & Algorithms - Task Management System

## Overview
This project is a **Task Management System** developed in Java to apply and demonstrate core **Data Structures and Algorithms** concepts.  
It covers **Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, and Task Scheduling** while integrating algorithm analysis and graph-based recommendations.

---

## Features
- **Core Data Structures**:
  - `Stack`, `Queue`, `SingleLinkedList`, and `Node` classes.
  - `Task` objects managed with add, delete, and search operations.

- **Algorithms**:
  - Sorting (Merge Sort, Enhanced Selection Sort).
  - Task scheduling and prioritization.
  - Graph algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford) for task recommendations.

- **Complexity Analysis**:
  - Big-O notation applied to compare algorithm performance.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:AmrAdi7/data-structures-algorithms.git
   cd data-structures-algorithms
   ```

2. Open the project in your IDE (IntelliJ / Eclipse / VS Code).

3. Compile and run:
   ```bash
   javac src/*.java
   java src.Main
   ```

---

## Example Use Cases
- Add tasks and manage them using **Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists**.  
- Sort tasks using **Merge Sort or Enhanced Selection Sort**.  
- Recommend task paths using **Graph algorithms**.

---

## Future Improvements
- GUI-based task manager.  
- Database integration for task persistence.  
- More advanced scheduling algorithms.
